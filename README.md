# WhatsApp Bot Example

This repository contains a simple example of a WhatsApp bot built with [whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js). The bot echoes back any received message.

## Setup
1. Install Node.js (version 16 or later recommended).
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the bot:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Scan the generated QR code with your WhatsApp mobile app to authenticate.

Once authenticated, any text message you send to the bot will be echoed back.
You can also send `!ping` to receive a "pong" reply as a simple command.
